## Installing Node.JS
Before running everything, you must have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, or click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install.

## Installing DB Browser (optional)
If you wish to see what is inside the database file, you can use [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) this also can be use if you are debugging or monitoring user XP/Levels.

## Installing Packages
After installing [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), you need to install all of the packages listed in `package.json` file. On Console/Terminal, run `npm install` command to install all of uninstalled packages. Wait for it to finish and you good to go!

## File Setup
After installing packages, now you can copy your Discord Bot Token in `config.json.example` file, and rename `config.json.example` to `config.json`, fill your Discord Bot Token, your User ID and Prefix. After that, you can choose which Rank Card you wish to use for Your Discord Bot:
